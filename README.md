## Reflection

I have built a Code snippet library that allows users to store and manage small pieces of reusable code. In this library, you can create new snippets, search for existing ones, update them, and delete those that are no longer useful. It is a good way to store useful snippets of code in an ordered fashion, that you can reuse in the future.

This assignment is a continuation of the previous project, where I built the back end for the application. In this project, I have created a front end with the necessary functionality to make the code snippet library fully usable. Throughout the process I have strengthened my skills in React and CSS. I have done projects using these programming languages before, but revisiting them has been a good exercise. I also learned how to integrate frontend and backend technologies, which is something I had not done in this way before.

If I were to continue working on this project, I would start by implementing authentication so that users log in to access the application. I would also develop how the code snippets are presented and expand the filtering options beyond just language. Additionally, I would spend more time refining the visual design of the page, which is something I enjoy doing and can spend a lot of time on.
